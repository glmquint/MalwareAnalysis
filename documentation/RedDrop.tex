Naughty maid is the adult theme app name of the remaining four malware analyzed, the goal of the virus is to log to a remote chinese server sensitive information like position and stored files and, in addition, can make the phone subscribe to paid SMS services  and cancel the SMS afterwards to hide its malicious behavior.

\section{File differences}
As previously stated we received four files identified by their SHA256 hash:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0b8bae30da84fb181a9ac2b1dbf77eddc5728fab8dc5db44c11069fef1821ae6
	\item 0b41181a6b9c85b8fa5c8e8c836ac24dd6e738a0d843f0b81b46ffe41b925818
	\item 0c05e5035951e260725d15392c8792a4941f92f868558e8b90b52977d832a70d
	\item 0c40fb505fb96ca9aed220f48a3c6c22318d889efa62bc7aaeee98f3a740afab
\end{itemize}
 
To make sure they were basically the same thing we used a jar compare tool that confirmed the practical equality between them. Only 0c05 presented a little more difference, mainly in the AndroidManifest.xml file, but otherwise remained the same w.r.t. the other files (Fig. \ref{fig:jarCompare}).

From this point forward we will always reference the 0c05 file and its content when speaking about this virus and, if there will be any differences, they will be pointed out.

\section{Static Analysis}

In addition the 0c40 file received a score of 33/59, this indicates that, even if the file are practically the same, even small changes can affect the malware fingerprint which changes its detect-ability from anti-viruses. In particular a common anti-malware such as MalwareBytes was not able to recognize the software as malicious in every case.
